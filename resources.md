# Resources

`SPARK` provides a multitude of resources for all interested parties, both within the [CSD department](https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-sciences-and-disorders/) and across campus.

You can find further information regarding the different types below.

## Consulting and support

One of `SPARK`'s main endeavors is to provide consulting and direct support for researchers across all levels concerning everything related to 

- **`data science`**, including:
  - `data standardization` and `management`
  - `preprocessing` and `analyses`
  - `visualization` and `evaluation`
  - `analysis workflows`
  
- **`AI`**, including:
  - `development` of new and `application` of existing `models`
  - `fine-tuning` of existing `models`
  - `model evaluation`

- **`computational work`**, including:
  - `programming` in `bash`, `python` and `R` (other languages such as `HTML` or `Matlab` are also supported)
  - `version control` for `code` and `data`
  - `computational environments`, e.g. `virtualization` and `HPC`
  - `software development` and `continuous integration`

- **`open and reproducible science`**, including:
  - `data` and `code sharing`
  - `data management plans`
  - open `repositories`
  - `reliability`, `robustness`, `reproducibility` and `generalizability` of `analyses`

This concerns active, ie currently running projects, as well as the preparation and submission of grants.

If you would like to talk to us about any of these topics, please consult the [contact page](https://spark-csd.github.io/contact/) on how to best reach us.

## Training and education

Regarding all of the above-mentioned aspects, `SPARK` is providing regular `training` via `open educational resources`, free for everyone to use. These materials can used as a `self-learning resource` and are taught as `modules` with instructors from the `SPARK team`. Importantly, across all, only open-source and free tools are being utilized in order to allow everyone to participate.

You can find the current list of `modules` below:



If you have a question concerning the materials, please consult the [contact page](https://spark-csd.github.io/contact/) on how to best reach us or use the respective `GitHub` repository or the `hypothes.is` feature on the `module` website.

## Community building and collaboration

`SPARK` is committed to foster an open and inclusive environment for everyone feels safe and supported. We therefore focus on creating respective opportunities and spaces for people to come and work together. There are enough "science islands" and we have to work towards building bridges and changing the defaults.

If that's something that's interesting to you, please have a look at our corresponding efforts below:


If you would like to join for any of these, please feel free to just stop by or consult the [contact page](https://spark-csd.github.io/contact/) on how to best reach us.

## Repositories and Platforms

Given our mission, we aim to make as much of our work publicly available, no matter of code, datasets, etc. . To make this outcomes as `FAIR` as possible we follow existing standards and best practices, as well as utilize a wide range of community-supported platforms. Please make sure to also check out our presence there.
