# About

SPARK (Statistics and Data Science Partnership for Applied Research in Communication Sciences and Disorders) aims to provide high-quality statistical and data science support to faculty and students in the communication sciences and disorders field, with the goal of promoting rigorous, impactful, and reproducible research. Through our services and initiatives, we aim to empower researchers to conduct translational research that advances the understanding and treatment of communication disorders. We also strive to foster a collaborative and inclusive community of researchers and promote the use of open science practices in the field.

Given our mission, we aim to make as much of our work publicly available, no matter of code, datasets, etc. . To make this outcomes as `FAIR` as possible we follow existing standards and best practices, as well as utilize a wide range of community-supported platforms. Please make sure to also check out our presence there.
